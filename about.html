        <p>
          I`ve always taken life as a journey from one experience to another. 
          So far it has been a road full of interesting events. 
          Full of love and happiness and also there has been lots of letting go of events, places, and people. 
          I`ve never looked back on my decisions and thought that any of them were wrong or not. 
          I made a plan and kept walking on it without regrettng anything. 
          I`ve never stopped creating new life events because in my eyes life is a pure act of creation full of opportunities that arise from every new moment.
